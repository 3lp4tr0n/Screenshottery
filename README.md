# Screenshottery
Simple spyware that takes screenshots on target computer every "x" amount of seconds.
Sends the screenshots over TLS.

## Client
Program.cs is the client side program. Need to make changes so that the compressed zip folder and PNG screenshots are kept hidden. 

## Server
Used SimpleHTTPSUpload.py
